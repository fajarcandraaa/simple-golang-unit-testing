We will learn about implementing in Golang.

## Topics :
- Setting up the Golang Project
- Defining the Product Entity
- Connecting to the database
- Implementing Unit test with 1 feature to find data by ID

## Our Step :
- In the first step, we create an entities to represent the structure of our data in the entity package
- In the second step, we create query a function to handle our query
- Then register the new function in our model interface
- In the third step, we create algorithm function to handle all condition in our flow proccess
- and again, we register it into source contract interface
- In fourth step is create faker data or mock data
- than, we create a seederes, to input fake data to database testing
- And the last step is, we create unit test with 2 case, 1 positive cae and 1 negative case

## Notes :
Last but not least, let's start to try to write a function that we think will be used many times in helpers.
Happy coding and keep learning ðŸ˜œ
